To use our application you **need**:

- Java

- Your choice of IDE


## Setup

Choose your IDE (we recommend using IntelliJ) and follow the download steps provided on their website.


Go to https://github.com/HermanForsberg/TDA367-projekt

Click the green button that says "code".
Choose "Download zip" from the dropdown menu.
Locate the zip file in your Downloads folder and unzip the file.

Open the project, locate the main file under TDA367-projekt/src/java.

The first time you run the program you will need to delete the lastCheckedDate.ser and quests.ser files,
if they exist.

Use the play button located in the top right corner to start the program. 

NOTE: The visuals are not very good in Apple software because of the white colours.
